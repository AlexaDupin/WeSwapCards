          <li>
            <p><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> Users are solely responsible for fulfilling their part of the card swap agreement, which takes place on the third-party platform. This includes ensuring that the card being swapped meets the agreed-upon description and coordinating with the other user.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>No Control or Liability:</strong> We do not control or participate in the actual card exchange process. We are not liable for any issues, disputes, or non-compliance that may arise during the swap process on the third-party platform.</p>
